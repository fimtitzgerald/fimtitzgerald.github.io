tagline: macOS + *nix focused Sysadmin
summary: 'I am a macOS and *nix focused Sysadmin currently based in Vancouver, B.C. I enjoy working in fast growth and fast paced environments with a focus on empowering users where possible 
and heavily relying on automation when needed. I am interested in how internal I.T. can leverage workflows from a DevOps approach - applying practices such as CI/CD, cloud native infrastructure,
code as infrastructure/documentation, etc.'
